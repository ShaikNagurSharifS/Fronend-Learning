export function namedExport() {
    console.log("This is the named export function.");
}

// You can add more named exports here if needed
// While it is possible to have multiple named exports in a single file,
// it's often a good practice to keep related functionalities together for better organization and maintainability.
// While importing need to use {}
// For example:
// import { namedExport } from './exportFunctionality/NamedExport';
